- So basically, im making an app anmed "AuthX" That Is A Keysystem Handler for Roblox "scripts". This app will be similar to luarmor where people will be able to make a keysystem for their scripts and users will have to complete various "Checkpoints" that ar4 shortner links like linkvertise, lootlabs etc and after completeing every checkpoint for a key the user will be able to generate a new key or renew an old key. Usually the people who generate the keys dont need an account and we store their data in browser sessions that are inexpirable. This product will have anti link bypass capabilities aswell.
